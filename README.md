 This project is a Blogs proof-of-concept for a new blogging platform, Special Cars, Inc.
 It's designed to give users the ability do discuss vehicles that they find to be different and special.
 
 This proof-of-concept highlits the UX and UI of the design.
 
 The Blogs app consists of 5 basic navigation pages: Home, Authors, Genres, Hashtags, and actual Posts.
 The Home page is just a landing page that greets the user and offers a navigation bar that will lead user to other pages.
 Authors, Genres and Hashtags pages allow user to see all Authors, Genres and Hashtags for all blog posts currently present. 
 Each page also contains a function to add new Authors, Genres and Blogs marked by a given Hashtag, respective to the page's name.
 The All Posts page is themed differently to distinguish it from other pages, since ALL of the blog posts are displayed there. 
 It also offers the ability for a user to add their own blog posts. All blog fields are made to be required to make sure all blogs are complete.
 Each individual blog post has a function to remove it from the app. 
 
 Any given hashtag can be attributed to any number of posts, and any post can have any number of hashtags. 
 A post can have only one author and genre, but any author can have multiple posts, and any genre can be assigned to multiple posts.
 
 I hope this proof is exactly what your client is looking for. 
 Any feedback and constructive criticism is welcome and requested.
 Thank you.
